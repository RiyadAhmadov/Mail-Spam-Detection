# Mail Spam Detection Project

![Mail Spam](https://assets-global.website-files.com/659415b46df8ea43c3877776/65a52bf7802d8418a2047245_email-marketing-spam-folder-88fcca5f.jpeg)

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting spam emails using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Spam emails, also known as junk emails, are unsolicited messages sent in bulk, often for advertising or phishing purposes. Detecting spam emails is crucial for maintaining email security and preventing users from falling victim to scams or malware.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of emails labeled as either spam or non-spam (ham). Each email is represented as text, which serves as the input data for the machine learning model. Features are extracted from the text data using NLP techniques such as tokenization, vectorization, and feature engineering.

## TensorFlow Model

The machine learning model used for spam detection is implemented using TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework. The model is trained on the labeled email dataset to learn patterns and characteristics of spam emails. TensorFlow provides a flexible and efficient platform for building and training deep learning models, which are well-suited for NLP tasks like text classification.

## Deployment

The trained TensorFlow model is deployed as a web application, allowing users to input text and receive predictions on whether the input text is likely to be spam or not. The web application is hosted on a web server and accessible through a web browser. Users can interact with the application by entering text into a text input field and submitting it to the model for prediction. The prediction results are displayed to the user, indicating whether the input text is classified as spam or non-spam.

## Deployment to GitHub

The code for the project, including the TensorFlow model implementation, web application, and deployment scripts, is available on GitHub. You can clone the repository, explore the code, and contribute to the project by submitting pull requests.
